# HW4
Write a C program to read keystroke input from stdin and write to stdout. The 	program is required to produce 2 processes: a producer process and a consumer 	process. A circular queue is shared between the producer and the consumer. The 	producer process reads keystrokes from stdin and write these keystrokes to the shared 	queue. The consumer process reads keystrokes from the shared queue and write the 	keystrokes to the stdout. The main() procedure will finish when both the producer and 	the consumer have terminated. The producer will terminate when receiving a keystroke 	of character ‘*’ from stdin. Similarly, the consumer will terminate when read the 	character ‘*’ from the queue.
